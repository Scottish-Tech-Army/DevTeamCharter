# DevTeamCharter

## Mission
The Dev Team are here to solve the problems of the Scottish Tech Army by delivering usable software. In turn this will help people during the current crisis and recovery brought on by the Covid-19 outbreak.

## The Team
The team is made up of skilled technologists, for the most part software developers with the capability to contribute to applications that will be deployed on the internet. An individuals value to the team will be measured primarily by their contribution.

## What will the team do
1. The team will write code
2. We will make the code available for anyone to read
3. We will only accept contributions from those on the team, although we will make it very easy to join the team
4. We will peer review all contributions before they are merged to master
5. We will push our contributions to the central repo after each session
6. We will be extremely nice to one another (I'm talking bake sale at a village church)
7. We will be transparent with our current endevours
8. We will deliver useable software as quickly as possible
9. We will rock you

## What we will not do
1. Pursue projects that don't have the support of the wider Scottish Tech Army group
2. Talk down to anyone. We're all on the same pay scale here!
3. Over promise and under deliver
4. Bike Shed (that is to spend an inordinate ammount of time talking about issues that have little consequence to the overall mission)
